## Rectified Flow

> By JamesSand


I have also implement a google colab. You can find the colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11pCMnpmV9H2cRhvT1mF1pVk_ySH3q0XZ?usp=sharing)


### Usage

- `train_gpu.py` can train a second order rectified flow model.
- `model_eval_origin.ipynb` can draw figure for original rectified flow
- `model_eval_2nd_order.ipynb` can draw figure for our second order algorithm. Currently we use `debug3` version model.
- `draw_distribution.ipynb` can draw original data distribution.
